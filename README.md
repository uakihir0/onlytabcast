# OnlyTabCast

This repository is a Chrome extension that allows you to cast tabs without launching the application for sites such as YouTube or Twitch when casting with ChromeCast. Currently, there is no feature to exclude specific sites. Since it supports Manifest V3, it can be used for a long time.
